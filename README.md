# AYA

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

---
## Problem Statement:

A simple responsive page, takes in a search query. Uses Googleâ€™s public search listing API from
YouTube (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) to generate a list of videos. Default
sort order is fine. The page should be optimised for rapid scroll, allowing users to quickly identify the
video to watch.
